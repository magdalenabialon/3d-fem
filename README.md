3dMe is a solution to assist with shopping for clothing online. Customers can provide their physical measurements and see the garments on a 3D representation of their body.
Currently under development, the app supports clothing colour, model height/weight and lighting simulations.
The project heavily relies on WebGL through the use of the three.js library.

Technologies used:
webGL, threejs, javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, 3d Modelling, texturing


 press [L] to toggle three-point lighting

 * OBJ loader for loading a geometry format that is as old and widely supported as GIFs.
 * MTL loader for loading really simple materials.
 * Orbit controls to smoothly turn the camera around the model.
 * Nearest-neighbor filtering and a pure white ambient light to showcase pixel art textures.
 * All libraries taken from the [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) repository.
